## Suggestions for an Official Assignment
    1. Add aditional instructions to clarify the expected behavior when exceptions are thrown and provide examples of valid and invalid opertaions.
    2. Add a delete method to remove keys from the database.
    3. Develop test cases that cover the expected behavior and test for unexpected behavior.
    4. Ask for a brief description of design decisions and how requirements were addressed.
